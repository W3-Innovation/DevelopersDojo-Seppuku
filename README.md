> #### **Sepuku Version 2 Release!**
>
> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seppuku released its official first production version today, if you are reading this then it has been published. There was a pervious version I had published, which was done on accident, however I left it in the VSCode market place as a few people liked it. The other version is being removed, and this version will be recieving regular updates moving forward. The frequency of updates will be contigent on the need to update themes due to VSCode updates, and the features released in those updates.</p>
>
> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The last thing I want to touch base on is this documentation/README-file. I can write half decent, however, I cannot not spell for crap, and I am prone to making gramatical errors. I am sure that I have some gramatical mistakes in here that need fixing, but I am currently tired as hell. So I will fix them in the next day or two, this is actually a second draft so it should be pretty readable. Anywho... I hope you your Seppuku experiance is a good one. If you have any feed back at all, please email me at my contact I posted above, **I want to here what you have to say!**</p>

### <i style="color: #DE1242">About Developers Dojo</i>

<hr style="border: none; background: #B50C40; height: 1px; max-width: 875px;">

<p style="min-width: 610px; max-width: 790px;">To explain Seppuku, I must first explain Developer’s Dojo. Developer's Dojo is a collection of themes that am currently developing. The collection consist of 3 Themes in all. Below this paragraph, I have listed all three themes. As of writing this, (March 2021) Suppuku is the only theme, of the three, to get published. Since all the themes have the same layout, share a syntax/semantics color-scheme, and are already partially developed, they too should release fairly soon.</p>

_The entire Developer's Dojo collection, once released, will be as follows:_

---

1.  Developer’s Dojo: Seppuku
1.  Developer’s Dojo: Bushido
1.  Developer’s Dojo: Uchigatana

### <i style="color: #DE1242">About Seppuku</i>

<hr style="border: none; background: #B50C40; height: 1px; max-width: 875px;">

<p style="min-width: 610px; max-width: 790px;">Seppuku is a dark theme that has a quintessential bichromatic pallete that is foundation of its entire design. All the color/shades used in the theme to style, and color the editor, were derived from the bichromatic pallete. Bellow I list the 3 colors that make up the pallete. (There are 3 colors, but black is nuetral, where the other two colors are compliments of each other, that is why, even though it has three colors, it is still considered bichromatic.)</p>

**Quintessential Bichromatic Pallete:**

<br>

<b style="font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; padding: 11px 28px; background: #FF0840; border: 2px solid #FFFFFF;">CRIMSON</b> &nbsp; &nbsp;
<b style="font-size: 14px; color: #00FF6A; padding: 11px 34px; background: #040C12; border: 2px solid #00FF6A;"> BLACK </b> &nbsp; &nbsp;
<b style="font-size: 14px; color: #D00040; padding: 11px 14px; background: #12FF7A; border: 3px solid #D00040;">MALACHITE</b> &nbsp; &nbsp;

<br>

<p style="min-width: 610px; max-width: 790px;">I tried styling the black so you could see it, but if your readme documents use a dark background it matbe hard. The black is more of a Gunmetal-black/Charcoal-black than a true black (#040C12). The quickest way to sum Seppuku up would be to call it a Red and Black theme, that gets the idea across, anywho, I hope you like it.</p>

### <i style="color: #DE1242">Last Couple Notes</i>

<hr style="border: none; background: #B50C40; height: 1px; max-width: 875px;">

-   <p style="min-width: 610px; max-width: 790px;">I put alot of effort into styling properties used by new features. This includes properties such as gitDecorations and Semantic highlighting selectors. So if you havn't equiped tab decorations yet, you should try them out.</p>

-   <p style="min-width: 610px; max-width: 790px;">Another place I put alot of extra time into was documenting the colors used by the theme. Currently I have a couple tables put together, but over the next few weeks I will have a more detailed color-refrance that Seppuku users can turn to if they want to know why something is highlighted a particular color.</p>

### <i style="color: crimson;">Taking Advantage of Contemporary Editor Features</i>

<hr style="border: none; background: #B50C40; height: 1px; max-width: 875px;">

<p style="min-width: 610px; max-width: 790px;">Below are a couple of setting configurations that I suggest using. This is obviously only a suggestion. Some of you will know exactly what these are, and if you desire to use them or not. For those who don't know what the settings below do, I posted a link below. I don't know why but I hardly see any devs take advantage of semantic tokens. I like theme becuase they make selecting syntax more consistant, as far as selecting all of somthing. For instance a standard textmate token that selects class names, only selects the declaration of the class, everywhere else it looks like any other variable, but semantic tokens lets developers select class names everywhere the are used (only the uppercased class name, not the objects created from the class). That is just one instence. I also took a ton of time coloring tab decorations as they were just release, and in my opinion take version control highlighting to a whole other level.</p>

#### **Here is a couple links to refer to in regards to the settings below:**

-   Semantic Selectors: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Semantic-Highlighting-Overview
-   Tab Decorations: https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_53#_tab-decorations

```
    {
        "semanticHighlighting": true,
        "workbench.editor.decorations.colors": true,
        "workbench.editor.decorations.badges": true,
    }
```
