## _The First of Three to be Released:_

---
Hello, and thank you for being here right now. You are currently reading from the README document for the VSCode theme 'Developer's Dojo: Seppuku'. Developer's Dojo is a collection of themes, and Seppuku (this theme) is the first one, of the three themes, to be released. Seppuku could be described as a Red and Black theme, but technicly it is a Dark Charcoal and Crimson theme. Of all the themes in the DevDojo collection, Seppuku was my favorite, and that is why I have finished and released it first. The shades of chorcoal used to color the larger parts of the editor, lends its dark tones to be used by crimsons bright crimson accents, and highlights. Why the crimson color finds its self in a sea of dark charcoal, it almost appears to be glowing radiant red energy. Seppuku is an extreamly refreshing theme, completley different from all the other themes that I have played with in the VSCode marketplace. 


I worked extreamly long hours creating the perfect color pallete for a Seppuku.  Developer's Dojo is a collection of themes, and Seppuku is the first of the three released. I really hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it!
